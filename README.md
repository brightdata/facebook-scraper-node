Facebook data as JSON, in JavaScript: page and group posts, comments, reels,
page details, profiles, reviews, Marketplace listings, events and the Meta Ad
Library. All eleven Bright Data Facebook scrapers, one function each. No
Facebook login, no browser, no dependencies. Built on the
[Bright Data Facebook Scraper API](https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper/facebook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=facebook-scraper-node).

Also here: a one-command CLI for page posts, and the
[Bright Data CLI](#facebook-mcp-server-and-claude-code-skill), which needs no JavaScript at all.

## How to scrape Facebook posts with Node.js

Node 20 or newer, and nothing to install: this is the built-in `fetch`. Save
it as a `.mjs` file, since it uses top-level `await`.

```bash
export BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Get a token from the
[Bright Data control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users). No
account yet? [Create one](https://brightdata.com/cp/start); new accounts get
[5,000 free credits a month](https://docs.brightdata.com/general/account/billing-and-pricing/free-tier).

```javascript
const API = "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3";
const HEADERS = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

async function call(path, body) {
  const init = body === undefined ? { headers: HEADERS } : { method: "POST", headers: HEADERS, body: JSON.stringify(body) };
  const response = await fetch(API + path, init);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${await response.text()}`);
  return response.json();
}

const page = { url: "https://www.facebook.com/Meta", num_of_posts: 3 };
const job = await call("/trigger?dataset_id=gd_lkaxegm826bjpoo9m5&include_errors=true", [page]);
while (!["ready", "failed"].includes((await call(`/progress/${job.snapshot_id}`)).status)) {
  await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 10_000));
}
for (const post of await call(`/snapshot/${job.snapshot_id}?format=json`)) {
  if (post.error) throw new Error(post.error);
  console.log(post.likes, post.num_comments, post.url);
}
```

```

7679 819 https://www.facebook.com/reel/29074877795478111/
```

Expect one to three minutes: the API runs a job and the loop waits for it.
Billed [per post](https://brightdata.com/pricing/web-scraper). Without a
token the first request fails with `HTTP 401`.

Two things in that snippet are not optional.

`num_of_posts` caps the run, and the bill. Without it a page returns, and
charges for, every post the scraper can reach.

`include_errors=true` makes the API report a dead or private page as a row
with an `error` key. The API default is off, and a failed page then looks the
same as a page with no posts.

The Bright Data [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/brightdata/sdk-js) wraps
nine of the eleven Facebook scrapers, not page details or the Ad Library.
Hence the plain HTTP, here and in this package.

## Scrape Facebook without a login or the Graph API

The Facebook Scraper API needs no Facebook account, no Facebook login, no Meta
app and no Graph API access token. The only credential is a Bright Data API
key, set as `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`. This package and its command also find the
key stored by `bdata login`. It collects what a logged-out visitor can see: a
private group or profile comes back as an error row.

## Bulk Facebook page posts CLI

The command in this repo runs the Node.js quickstart for several pages at once
and writes one JSON file.

```bash
npm install -g github:brightdata/facebook-scraper-node
facebook-scraper Meta Microsoft --limit 2
```

```
Fetching up to 2 recent posts per page, for: Meta, Microsoft
Usually one to three minutes each. Billed per post, 5,000 free credits a month.
asking  Meta...
got     Meta: 2 posts
asking  Microsoft...
got     Microsoft: 2 posts

Saved 4 posts as JSON to facebook.json (44 fields per post)
```

In a terminal the `asking` lines are replaced by a spinner and a running
clock, updating in place, so you can see it is working and how long it has
been going.

```
--limit N      posts per page, default 5, minimum 1
--out PATH     output file, default facebook.json
```

A page can be a name, `@Meta`, `facebook.com/Meta` or a full URL. The command
finds the token in `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`, or, if you ran
`npx -p @brightdata/cli bdata login` once, in the stored login, for you and
for any coding agent in that terminal. It does not read a `.env` file; Node
loads one for it with `node --env-file=.env`.

Import it instead of running it, for `ok`, `note` and `error` per page instead
of raw rows. This package is ESM, so use `import`, not `require`. `scrape`
never rejects for one bad page; check `ok` before reading `posts`:

```javascript
import { scrape } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const outcome of await scrape(["Meta", "zzqqxx-no-such-page-404"], { limit: 1 })) {
  if (outcome.ok) {
    console.log(`${outcome.page}: ${outcome.posts.length} posts`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${outcome.page} failed: ${outcome.error}`);
  }
}
```

```
Meta: 1 posts
zzqqxx-no-such-page-404 failed: Posts not found
```

A page that does not exist comes back as an error row, "Posts not found",
not as zero posts. That run, both pages one after the other, took 209
seconds. When a run returns some posts and some error rows, the posts are
kept, and the errors land in `note`.

## Scrape Facebook posts, comments, Marketplace, events and ads

Bright Data has eleven Facebook scrapers, each documented in the
[Facebook Scraper API docs](https://docs.brightdata.com/products/scrapers/facebook/introduction).
This package has one function for each way to call them. Every snippet below
is complete: paste it as is after the `npm install` above. Every one of them
runs in Actions each Monday, a smaller check runs every other day, and the
badge at the top is the latest result.

| you have | want | how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| page URLs | their recent posts | `pagePosts(urls, { limit: 5 })` |
| public group URLs | their recent posts | `groupPosts(urls, { limit: 5 })` |
| post URLs | those posts | `posts(urls)` |
| post URLs | their comments | `comments(urls, { limit: 10 })`, billed per comment |
| page URLs | their recent reels | `reels(urls, { limit: 5 })` |
| page URLs | page details: followers, category, contact info | `pages(urls)` |
| profile URLs of people | public profile details | `profiles(urls)` |
| a page's `/reviews/` URL | its reviews | `reviews(urls, { limit: 10 })` |
| a keyword and a city | Marketplace listings | `marketplaceSearch("bicycle", "New York", { limit: 5 })` |
| a Marketplace category URL | its listings | `marketplaceCategory(url, { limit: 5 })` |
| Marketplace item URLs | those listings | `marketplace(urls)` |
| a venue page's `/events` URL | its upcoming events | `eventsByVenue(url, { limit: 5 })` |
| an events search URL | matching events | `eventsSearch(url, { limit: 5 })` |
| event URLs | those events | `events(urls)` |
| a keyword and a country | ads in the Meta Ad Library | `adsSearch("coffee", { country: "US", limit: 5 })` |
| Ad Library ad URLs | those ads | `ads(urls)` |

Each takes one URL or an array. An array is one job, not one per URL. Each
resolves to an array of rows, and a row the API could not collect carries an
`error` key instead of the record. Functions that take a limit pass any other
input the API accepts in the same options object, named as the API names it:
`pagePosts(url, { limit: 10, start_date: "10-01-2026" })`.

### Scrape Facebook page posts from several pages in one job

```javascript
import { pagePosts } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

const urls = ["https://www.facebook.com/Meta", "https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft"];
for (const post of await pagePosts(urls, { limit: 1 })) {
  console.log(post.page_name, post.date_posted, post.likes, post.url);
}
```

```

### Scrape Facebook group posts

Public groups only. The records name the people who posted; this prints the
group and the counts.

```javascript
import { groupPosts } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const post of await groupPosts("https://www.facebook.com/groups/532855527252024", { limit: 2 })) {
  console.log(post.group_name.slice(0, 40), post.group_members, post.date_posted, post.num_comments);
}
```

### Scrape a Facebook post by URL

```javascript
import { posts } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

const url = "https://www.facebook.com/Meta/posts/pfbid0evGHWPACd3JninWg3j3nucQjdFxoHWwJSPgFXKjZXaUiU8MctREDPRZZsAps6CGwl";
const [post] = await posts(url);
console.log(post.user_username_raw, post.likes, post.num_comments, post.num_shares);
console.log(post.content.slice(0, 70));
```

```
Meta 595 343 194

```

### Scrape Facebook comments from a post

Billed per comment, so check `num_comments` on the post first. The limit
goes to the API as `limit_records`.

```javascript
import { comments } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

const url = "https://www.facebook.com/Meta/posts/pfbid0evGHWPACd3JninWg3j3nucQjdFxoHWwJSPgFXKjZXaUiU8MctREDPRZZsAps6CGwl";
const rows = await comments(url, { limit: 3 });
console.log(rows.length, "comments; first:", rows[0].date_created, rows[0].num_likes, "likes");
```

```
3 comments; first: 2026-10-31T01:48:29.000Z 10 likes
```

### Scrape Facebook reels from a page

```javascript
import { reels } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const reel of await reels("https://www.facebook.com/Meta", { limit: 2 })) {
  console.log(reel.date_posted, reel.video_view_count, "views", reel.url);
}
```

```

```

### Scrape Facebook page data

```javascript
import { pages } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

const [page] = await pages("https://www.facebook.com/Meta");
console.log(page.page_name, page.followers, "followers,", page.primary_category);
```

```
Meta 106000000 followers, Company
```

### Scrape a Facebook profile

Public profile details only, what a logged-out visitor sees.

```javascript
import { profiles } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

const [profile] = await profiles("https://www.facebook.com/zuck");
console.log(profile.name, "|", profile.city);
```

```
Mark Zuckerberg | Palo Alto
```

### Scrape Facebook reviews of a business page

Pass the page's `/reviews/` URL. Many brand pages have reviews turned off and
return an error row, "Reviews not found" or a dead page, instead of zero rows.
This prints the verdicts, not the reviewers.

```javascript
import { reviews } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const review of await reviews("https://www.facebook.com/TheGarden/reviews/", { limit: 3 })) {
  console.log(review.company_name, review.review_time, "recommends:", review.recommends);
}
```

```
Madison Square Garden 2026-10-31T14:43:54.000Z recommends: true
Madison Square Garden 2026-10-21T12:28:03.000Z recommends: true
Madison Square Garden 2026-10-19T22:29:17.000Z recommends: false
```

### Scrape Facebook Marketplace listings

```javascript
import { marketplaceSearch } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const item of await marketplaceSearch("bicycle", "New York", { limit: 3 })) {
  if (!item.error) {
    // rows the limit cancelled carry only an error
    console.log(item.final_price, item.currency, item.title.slice(0, 40), "|", item.location);
  }
}
```

```
30 USD Bike | Hackensack, NJ
40 USD Huffy Nel Lusso Cruiser Bike | Long Beach, NY
120 USD fat tire bicycle | Uniondale, NY
```

`marketplaceCategory(url, { limit: 5 })` does the same from a category URL,
such as `https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/category/vehicles`, and
`marketplace(urls)` collects listings you already have the URLs of.

### Scrape Facebook events at a venue

Pass the venue page's `/events` URL. The bare page URL finds no events.

```javascript
import { eventsByVenue } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const event of await eventsByVenue("https://www.facebook.com/TheGarden/events", { limit: 3 })) {
  console.log(event.event_date, event.title);
}
```

```
2026-11-04T00:00:00.000Z NY Rangers vs St. Louis Blues Premium Seating
2026-11-05T00:30:00.000Z New York Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls
2026-11-04T00:00:00.000Z New York Rangers vs. St. Louis Blues
```

`eventsSearch(url, { limit: 5 })` takes an events search URL, such as
`https://www.facebook.com/events/search/?q=marathon`. Its matching is loose:
check the titles it returns.

### Scrape the Facebook Ad Library

```javascript
import { adsSearch } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

for (const ad of await adsSearch("coffee", { country: "US", limit: 3 })) {
  if (!ad.error) {
    // rows the limit cancelled carry only an error
    console.log(ad.advertiser_name, "| active:", ad.is_active, "| since", ad.start_date);
  }
}
```

```
Dame Fine Coffee | active: true | since 2026-06-11T07:00:00.000Z
Biggby Coffee of Wickliffe Ohio | active: true | since 2025-04-29T07:00:00.000Z
Wall Stadium | active: true | since 2026-04-22T07:00:00.000Z
```

`ad_type` defaults to `"All ads"`, the value the API validates; `"all"` is
rejected. A discovery that reaches its limit cancels the crawls still running,
and each comes back as a row whose error is "Crawl aborted on job cancel".
`split()` treats those as the limit working, not as failures.

### Trigger now, fetch later

For anything bigger than a few pages, do not hold a process for an hour.
Trigger, keep the snapshot id, fetch when ready. Snapshots stay downloadable
for 30 days.

```javascript
import { PAGES, fetchSnapshot, status, trigger } from "@brightdata/facebook-scraper-node";

const snapshot = await trigger(PAGES, [{ url: "https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft" }]);
console.log("snapshot:", snapshot);
let state;
while (!["ready", "failed"].includes((state = await status(snapshot)))) {
  await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 10_000));
}
console.log("status:", state);
console.log("fetched:", (await fetchSnapshot(snapshot))[0].page_name);
```

```
snapshot: sd_mw133n4lv23hvuqep
status: ready
fetched: Microsoft
```

`trigger` takes any dataset, `discoverBy` and `limitPerInput`, so it reaches
every scraper in the table. Each input was accepted by the live API on
2026-11-03, and several differ from the API reference pages:

| scraper | dataset_id | discover_by | input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page posts | `gd_lkaxegm826bjpoo9m5` | none | `{"url", "num_of_posts"}` |
| Group posts | `gd_lz11l67o2cb3r0lkj3` | none | `{"url", "num_of_posts"}` |
| Post by URL | `gd_lyclm1571iy3mv57zw` | none | `{"url"}` |
| Comments | `gd_lkay758p1eanlolqw8` | none | `{"url", "limit_records"}`. `num_of_comments` is rejected |
| Reels | `gd_lyclm3ey2q6rww027t` | none | `{"url", "num_of_posts"}` |
| Pages | `gd_mf124a0511bauquyow` | none | `{"url"}` |
| Profiles | `gd_mf0urb782734ik94dz` | none | `{"url"}` |
| Company reviews | `gd_m0dtqpiu1mbcyc2g86` | none | `{"url", "num_of_reviews"}`, a `/reviews/` URL |
| Marketplace item | `gd_lvt9iwuh6fbcwmx1a` | none | `{"url"}` |
| Marketplace search | `gd_lvt9iwuh6fbcwmx1a` | `keyword` | `{"keyword", "city"}` required |
| Marketplace category | `gd_lvt9iwuh6fbcwmx1a` | `url` | `{"url"}` |
| Event | `gd_m14sd0to1jz48ppm51` | none | `{"url"}` |
| Events search | `gd_m14sd0to1jz48ppm51` | `url` | `{"url"}`, an `/events/search/?q=` URL |
| Events at a venue | `gd_m14sd0to1jz48ppm51` | `venue` | `{"url", "upcoming_events_only"}`, a `/events` URL |
| Ad | `gd_mtveskb62h7q65ftgz` | none | `{"url"}` |
| Ads search | `gd_mtveskb62h7q65ftgz` | `keyword` | `{"keyword", "country", "ad_type"}`, `ad_type` `"All ads"` |

`bdata pipelines info <dataset_id> <method>` prints the input fields the API
validates.

## Facebook post data fields (JSON)

The fields most people want from a page post:

```
url  date_posted  content  likes  num_comments  num_shares  page_name  page_followers
```

The code hardcodes no field list. Whatever the API returns lands in each row,
and in the command's file.

<!-- fields:start -->
Regenerated every day from the published schema,
[scrapers-full.json](https://docs.brightdata.com/scrapers-full.json), so they cannot go stale. A record
carries the fields that apply to it, plus `timestamp` and `input`; the
sample file's first post has 44 keys.

## Facebook scraper errors

| you see | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| `API token required but not found.` | Exit 2, before any request. Set the token, or run `bdata login`. |
| `failed  page: Posts not found` | Exit 1. No such page, a private one, or a page with no public posts. Check the name. |
| `failed  page: timeout: snapshot ... not ready after 900s` | Exit 1. Run it again, or fetch the snapshot later with `fetchSnapshot()`. |
| `failed  page: HTTP 401: ...` | The token is set but wrong. |

Any failure exits 1, so a run is safe to gate a script on.

From the functions, the same conditions look like this:

| you see | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| `TokenMissing` | No `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN` and no `bdata login`. |
| `ApiError: HTTP 400: ...validation_error...` | An input field the API does not accept. The message names it; compare with the table above. |
| a row with an `error` key | The API's answer for one input: "Posts not found", a dead page, "Reviews not found", "There are no events." The other rows are fine. |
| `ApiError: timeout: ...` | The job outlived the 900-second wait. Pass `{ timeoutMs }` to `run`, or use `trigger` and fetch later. |

## Facebook MCP server and Claude Code skill

No JavaScript, nothing installed. Paste both lines; the first opens a browser
once, or use `bdata login --device` over SSH and in CI:

```bash
npx -p @brightdata/cli bdata login
npx -p @brightdata/cli bdata pipelines run gd_lkaxegm826bjpoo9m5 collect_by_url --url "https://www.facebook.com/Meta" --num_of_posts 2 --pretty
```

2 records, up to 38 fields, 113 seconds on 3 Nov 2026. The CLI leaves out fields that are null.

The CLI runs a scraper by its dataset ID, every Facebook one included.
`bdata pipelines search facebook` lists their IDs and methods, and
`--limit-per-input N` caps a discovery, 10 by default.

`npx skills add brightdata/skills` teaches Claude Code, Cursor and Codex these
commands and the docs, so plain language works afterwards. Full guide:
[Bright Data for your coding agent](https://docs.brightdata.com/quickstart-coding-agent).

No terminal, for a hosted assistant? The
[Bright Data MCP server](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp#which-tool-to-use)
runs any pre-built scraper, Facebook included, through `search_scrapers` and
`run_scraper` in its `scrapers` group:

    https://mcp.brightdata.com/mcp?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN&groups=scrapers

An agent can also open the account itself, no signup form:
[agent registration](https://brightdata.com/auth.md). Everything else Bright
Data connects to, from LangChain to Zapier and n8n:
[integrations](https://docs.brightdata.com/integrations/introduction).
